# Run Mode

scmcphub provides two distinct run modes to accommodate different user needs and preferences.

## Tool Mode

In tool mode, scmcphub provides a curated set of predefined functions that the LLM can select and execute.

**Advantages:**
- **Stable**: Predefined functions ensure consistent and reliable execution
- **Predictable**: Known behavior and expected outputs
- **Safe**: Controlled environment with validated operations

**Disadvantages:**
- **Limited flexibility**: Restricted to available predefined functionsï¼Œ you should define new tools when you need customization functions

### Usage
Running in terminal
```bash
scmcp run --run-mode tool
```

Below are some examples:

Configure mcp
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "scmcp": {
      "command": "/home/test/bin/scmcp",
      "args": [
         "run", "--run-mode", "tool"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Code Mode

In code mode, scmcphub provides a Jupyter backend that allows the LLM to generate and execute custom code.

The mode is based on the project https://github.com/huang-sh/abcoder

**Advantages:**
- **Highly flexible**: Can create custom workflows and combine operations freely
- **Extensible**: Supports any Python code and external libraries
- **Interactive**: Real-time code execution and debugging capabilities

**Disadvantages:**
- **Less stable**: Code generation is different for each time

### Usage
Running in terminal
```bash
scmcp run --run-mode code
```

Configure mcp
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "scmcp": {
      "command": "/home/test/bin/scmcp",
      "args": [
         "run", "--run-mode", "code"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
