# Code Mode

The code Mode depends on [abcoder](https://github.com/huang-sh/abcoder)

In code Mode, usually you don't need develop tools, because LLM generate code, and jupyter execute code.
But if you Always want to call same codes or specific code execution. You also can develop mcp tool in code mode,
just refer to tool-mode, define schemata, server, use get_nbm to get jupyter backend.

## Overview

Code mode is designed for interactive analysis workflows where the LLM generates code that gets executed in Jupyter notebooks. This mode leverages the `NotebookManager` backend to handle multiple notebook instances with different kernels.

## Key Components

### NotebookManager

The `NotebookManager` is the core backend for code mode operations. It provides:

- **Multi-notebook Management**: Handle multiple Jupyter notebook instances
- **Code Execution**: Execute generated code with proper error handling
- **Notebook Persistence**: Save and load notebook states

For complete documentation, see [NotebookManager Reference](./notebook-manager.mdx).

### Backend Access

Use `get_nbm()` to access the NotebookManager in your MCP tools:

```python
from scmcp_shared.util import get_nbm

@mcp.tool(tags=["nb"])
def execute_code(code: str):
    """Execute code in the active Jupyter notebook."""
    nbm = get_nbm()
    jce = nbm.active_notebook
    result = jce.execute(code)
    return result
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Server Configuration

Configure your MCP server to use NotebookManager backend:

```python
from scmcp_shared.mcp_base import BaseMCPManager
from abcoder.backend import NotebookManager
from scmcp_shared.util import get_nbm

mcp = FastMCP(name="MyAssistantServer")

@mcp.tool
def print_hello():
    nbm = get_nbm()

    # Get the active notebook
    jce = nbm.active_notebook
    
    code = "print('hello')"
    # Execute the code
    result = jce.execute(code)


class MyCodeModeManager(BaseMCPManager):
    def init_mcp(self):
        self.available_modules = {
            "nb": nb_mcp,
            "p": mcp,
        }

# Create manager with NotebookManager backend
manager = MyCodeModeManager(
    name="my-code-mcp",
    backend=NotebookManager,
    include_tags=["nb"]
)
```
